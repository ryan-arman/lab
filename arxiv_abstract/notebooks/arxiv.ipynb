barrier fusion reactions which are closely connected with the tunneling phenomena  @xcite .    for most of the potential barriers , the penetrability can not be calculated analytically  @xcite . among those potentials for which analytical solutions can be obtained , \\n the parabolic potential  @xcite is the mostly used in the study of nuclear fusion . by approximating the coulomb barrier to a parabola \\n , wong derived an analytic expression for the fusion cross section  @xcite which is widely adopted today in the study of heavy ion reactions ( see , e.g. , recent refs . \\n the parabolic approximation works remarkably well both for the penetrability and for the fusion cross section at energies around or above the coulomb barrier  @xcite . \\n apparently the parabolic approximation breaks down at energies much smaller than the barrier height due to the long -

      "We present a unified thermodynamic study of the pseudospin–electron (PE) model, which describes strongly correlated electrons coupled to local anharmonic lattice degrees of freedom represented by pseudospins. Focusing on two complementary interaction regimes, we (i) analyze the case of direct long-range pseudospin–pseudospin coupling in the absence of electron hopping using a mean-field approximation, and (ii) study the limit without direct pseudospin coupling or Hubbard on-site correlation, where pseudospin interactions are mediated by conducting electrons and treated within a generalized random-phase approximation (GRPA) with mean-field corrections in the strong-coupling (Hubbard-I-type) limit. We derive expressions for the grand canonical potential, order parameters, and electron concentration, and compute phase diagrams for fixed chemical potential and fixed electron density. Main findings include the emergence of first-order and second-order phase transitions, field- and concentration-driven phase coexistence and phase separation, ferroelectric and antiferroelectric ordering, and a modulated (chess-board) phase stabilized in parts of parameter space. Electron-spectrum reconstruction accompanies some transitions. The PE model thus displays a rich variety of equilibrium states—including bistability and spatially inhomogeneous phases—relevant to cuprate apical-oxygen dynamics and proton–electron coupling in hydrogen-bonded materials.\n"
