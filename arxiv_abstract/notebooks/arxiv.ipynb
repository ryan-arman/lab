barrier fusion reactions which are closely connected with the tunneling phenomena  @xcite .    for most of the potential barriers , the penetrability can not be calculated analytically  @xcite . among those potentials for which analytical solutions can be obtained , \\n the parabolic potential  @xcite is the mostly used in the study of nuclear fusion . by approximating the coulomb barrier to a parabola \\n , wong derived an analytic expression for the fusion cross section  @xcite which is widely adopted today in the study of heavy ion reactions ( see , e.g. , recent refs . \\n the parabolic approximation works remarkably well both for the penetrability and for the fusion cross section at energies around or above the coulomb barrier  @xcite . \\n apparently the parabolic approximation breaks down at energies much smaller than the barrier height due to the long - range coulomb interaction . \\n one may calculate the penetration probability numerically by using the path integral method or the wkb approximation . \\n however , it is highly desirable to have an analytical expression for the barrier penetrability when one introduces an energy - dependent one - dimensional potential barrier  @xcite or barrier distribution functions  @xcite .    in the present work \\n , we derived a new barrier penetration formula based on the wkb approximation . \\n the influence of the long coulomb tail in the barrier potential is taken into accout properly . \\n therefore this formula is especially applicable to the barrier penetration with penetration energy much lower than the coulomb barrier .    as a first attempt and a test study \\n , we apply this new formula to evaluate @xmath0 decay half -

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the deformation influences the @xmath0 decay life time both on the preformation mechanism and on the penetration process  @xcite . in the present work , we have assumed the barrier potential to be spherical . in 68 of these 344 nuclei \\n , the spherical potential assumption is met well ( with @xmath41 for the daughter nucleus  @xcite ) . in table \\n [ tab : spherical ] the calculated and experimental values of the @xmath0 decay half lives for these nuclei are given . the statistical summary is also shown in the last line of table  [ tab : stati ] . \\n it is found that the new formula gives very good results for these spherical nuclei . in most cases , the differences between the calculated and the experimental values of @xmath42 are smaller than 0.5 . \\n the root mean square deviation between @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] is 0.34 . \\n in the study of barrier penetration in nuclear physics , the parabolic approximation is usually adopted because an analytical solution exists for the penetrability of a parabola barrier potential . \\n the parabola approximation works indeed well both for the penetrability and for the fusion cross section at energies around or above the coulomb barrier . \\n but it fails at energies much smaller than the barrier height due to the long - range coulomb interaction .    in the present work \\n , we derived a new barrier penetration formula , eq . \\n ( [ eq : new ] ) , based on the wkb approximation . \\n we took into account the influence of the long coulomb tail in the barrier potential properly . \\n therefore this formula is especially applicable to the barrier penetration with penetration energy much lower than the coulomb barrier . \\n we have shown that the present analytical formula reproduces the wkb results very well . \\n this new penetration formula is used to calculate @xmath0 decay half - lives of 344 nuclei with the @xmath0-nucleus potential given in ref . \\n satisfactory agreement between the present calculation and the experiment is achieved . for spherical and even - even nuclei , \\n the results are particularly good . \\n therefore , the new formula could be used in the study of barrier penetration at energies much smaller than the barrier height . \\n furthermore , we expect that the new formula will facilitate the study of the barrier penetrability where one has to introduce an energy - dependent one - dimensional potential barrier or a barrier distribution function . \\n this work was partly supported by the national natural science foundation ( 10575036 , 10705014 , and 10875157 ) , the major state basic research development program of china ( 2007cb815000 ) , the knowledge innovation project of cas ( kjcx3-syw - n02 and kjcx2-sw - n17 ) , and deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft . \\n the computation of this work was supported by supercomputing center , cnic , cas . \\n in order to evaluate the integration @xmath45 in eq . \\n ( [ eq : x1x2 ] ) , we divide the potential between the position of the barrier @xmath11 and the outer turning point @xmath5 into two parts , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . \\n @xmath48 should be large enough so that the nuclear potential vanishes for @xmath49 . for s \\n wave , @xmath50 it has been verified that when @xmath48 is not very close to @xmath5 , @xmath51 , therefore , @xmath52\\\\ dr   \\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\   &    & \\\\mbox { } +   2 \\\\int^{r _ \\\\mathrm{out } } _ { r_\\\\mathrm{v } }      \\\\sqrt { \\\\frac{2\\\\mu } { \\\\hbar^2 } \\\\left ( v_\\\\mathrm{c}(r ) - e \\\\right ) } \\\\ dr   \\\\nonumber   \\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] @xmath53 since the coulomb potential outside the barrier ( @xmath54 ) is well described by [ c.f . \\n ( [ eq : coulomb ] ] , @xmath55 the first term in the above equation can be evaluated easily as , @xmath56   , \\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] with @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for the evaluation of the second term in eq . \\n ( [ eq : x1x2_approx ] ) , we adopt a woods - saxon form for the nuclear part of the barrier potential , @xmath57 }   , \\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] and replace @xmath58 in the denominator by @xmath59 , @xmath60   \\\\right\\\\ } \\\\right|_{r_b}^ { r _ { \\\\mathrm{v } } }   \\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\   & \\\\approx &   \\\\frac { k } { \\\\sqrt { \\\\tau - 1 } } \\\\frac{v_0}{e }   \\\\ {   r_0- r_b + a \\\\ln [ 1 + e^ { ( r_b - r_0 ) / a } ]   \\\\ }   \\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\   & = &   \\\\frac { k a } { \\\\sqrt { \\\\tau - 1 } } \\\\frac{v_0}{e }   \\\\ln [ 1 + e^ { ( r_0 - r_b ) / a } ]   .\\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] in the above derivation , we have used the fact that @xmath61 \\\\gg 1 $ ] for @xmath0 decay and penetration well below the coulomb barrier . \\n finally , we have an analytical expression for @xmath45 , @xmath62   \\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\   &    & \\\\mbox { }   +   \\\\frac { k a } { \\\\sqrt { \\\\tau - 1 } } \\\\frac{v_0}{e }   \\\\ln [ 1 + e^ { ( r_0 - r_b ) / a } ]   .\\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ]'},\n",

      "Faithfulness (60/100):\n",
      "- The summary largely reflects the paper’s topic (object recognition to aid segmentation via b-scale and shape models) and the hierarchical recognition idea. However, it introduces a specific evaluation detail not present in the provided text: “a set of 20 routine clinical abdominal female and male CT data sets.” The number 20 is not supported by the text (which uses variables for the number of subjects and mentions only that data are routine PET/CT-derived CT scans).\n",
      "- It also paraphrases a reported finding as “recognition accuracy” improving with more objects, whereas the paper explicitly states “specificity” increases; this is a subtle but meaningful shift in the reported metric.\n",
      "- It slightly overstates the conclusion with “make delineation most accurate,” which is stronger than the paper’s framing that efficient recognition enables successful delineation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coverage (85/100):\n",
      "- The summary states the main problem (automatic object recognition to assist segmentation), the core method (model assembly, b-scale encoding of pose relationships, hierarchical/one-shot placement), and at least one main finding (more objects improve recognition; b-scale captures useful information).\n",
      "- It omits some specific components described in the paper, such as the intensity-weighted b-scale variant, the PCA-based pose system and transformation, and the optional refinement using the skin boundary, but overall covers the essential aspects adequately for a brief summary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarity (90/100):\n",
      "- Sentences are grammatical and understandable. Technical terms (b-scale, model assembly, hierarchical recognition) are used appropriately and in context. The meaning is clear to a technically literate reader.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conciseness (90/100):\n",
      "- The summary is focused, avoids filler, and includes only relevant information. Length is appropriate for an abstract-style summary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coherence (90/100):\n",
      "- The summary follows a logical structure (goal → method → key ideas → findings) and flows smoothly without contradictions.\n",

       "  'content': 'Paper Content:\\nadditive models @xcite provide an important family of models for semiparametric regression or classification . some reasons for the success of additive models are their increased flexibility when compared to linear or generalized linear models and their increased interpretability when compared to fully nonparametric models . \\n it is well - known that good estimators in additive models are in general less prone to the curse of high dimensionality than good estimators in fully nonparametric models . \\n many examples of such estimators belong to the large class of regularized kernel based methods over a reproducing kernel hilbert space @xmath0 , see e.g. @xcite . in the last years \\n many interesting results on learning rates of regularized kernel based models for additive models have been published when the focus is on sparsity and when the classical least squares loss function is used , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein . of course , the least squares loss function is differentiable and has many nice mathematical properties , but it is only locally lipschitz continuous and therefore regularized kernel based methods based on this loss function typically suffer on bad statistical robustness properties , even if the kernel is bounded . \\n this is in sharp contrast to kernel methods based on a lipschitz continuous loss function and on a bounded loss function , where results on upper bounds for the maxbias bias and on a bounded influence function are known , see e.g. @xcite for the general case and @xcite for additive models . \\n therefore , we will here consider the case of regularized kernel based methods based on a general convex and lipschitz continuous loss function , on a general kernel , and on the classical regularizing term @xmath1 for some @xmath2 which is a smoothness penalty but not a sparsity penalty , see e.g. @xcite . \\n such regularized kernel based methods are now often called support vector machines ( svms ) , although the notation was historically used for such methods based on the special hinge loss function and for special kernels only , we refer to @xcite .    in this paper we address the open question , whether an svm with an additive kernel can provide a substantially better learning rate in high dimensions than an svm with a general kernel , say a classical gaussian rbf kernel , if the assumption of an additive model is satisfied . \\n our leading example covers learning rates for quantile regression based on the lipschitz continuous but non - differentiable pinball loss function , which is also called check function in the literature , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for parametric quantile regression and @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for kernel based quantile regression . \\n we will not address the question how to check whether the assumption of an additive model is satisfied because this would be a topic of a paper of its own . \\n of course , a practical approach might be to fit both models and compare their risks evaluated for test data . \\n for the same reason we will also not cover sparsity . \\n consistency of support vector machines generated by additive kernels for additive models was considered in @xcite . in this paper \\n we establish learning rates for these algorithms . \\n let us recall the framework with a complete separable metric space @xmath3 as the input space and a closed subset @xmath4 of @xmath5 as the output space . \\n a borel probability measure @xmath6 on @xmath7 is used to model the learning problem and an independent and identically distributed sample @xmath8 is drawn according to @xmath6 for learning . \\n a loss function @xmath9 is used to measure the quality of a prediction function @xmath10 by the local error @xmath11 . \\n _ throughout the paper we assume that @xmath12 is measurable , @xmath13 , convex with respect to the third variable , and uniformly lipschitz continuous satisfying @xmath14 with a finite constant @xmath15 . \\n _    support vector machines ( svms ) considered here are kernel - based regularization schemes in a reproducing kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ) @xmath0 generated by a mercer kernel @xmath16 . with a shifted loss function @xmath17 introduced for dealing \\n even with heavy - tailed distributions as @xmath18 , they take the form @xmath19 where for a general borel measure @xmath20 on @xmath21 , the function @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a regularization parameter . \\n the idea to shift a loss function has a long history , see e.g. @xcite in the context of m - estimators . \\n it was shown in @xcite that @xmath22 is also a minimizer of the following optimization problem

we provide some learning rates for the support vector machines generated by additive kernels for additive models which helps improve the quantitative understanding presented in @xcite . \\n the rates are about asymptotic behaviors of the excess risk @xmath82 and take the form @xmath83 with @xmath84 . \\n they will be stated under three kinds of conditions involving the hypothesis space @xmath0 , the measure @xmath6 , the loss @xmath12 , and the choice of the regularization parameter @xmath85 . \\n the first condition is about the approximation ability of the hypothesis space @xmath0 . \\n since the output function @xmath19 is from the hypothesis space , the learning rates of the learning algorithm depend on the approximation ability of the hypothesis space @xmath0 with respect to the optimal risk @xmath86 measured by the following approximation error . \\n [ defapprox ] the approximation error of the triple @xmath87 is defined as @xmath88    to estimate the approximation error , we make an assumption about the minimizer of the risk @xmath89    for each @xmath90 , define the integral operator @xmath91 associated with the kernel @xmath41 by @xmath92 we mention that @xmath93 is a compact and positive operator on @xmath94 . hence we can find its normalized eigenpairs @xmath95 such that @xmath96 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath94 and @xmath97 as @xmath98 . fix @xmath99 . \\n then we can define the @xmath100-th power @xmath101 of @xmath93 by @xmath102 this is a positive and bounded operator and its range is well - defined . \\n the assumption @xmath103 means @xmath104 lies in this range . \\n [ assumption1 ] we assume @xmath105 and @xmath106 where for some @xmath107 and each @xmath108 , @xmath109 is a function of the form @xmath110 with some @xmath111 . \\n the case @xmath112 of assumption [ assumption1 ] means each @xmath113 lies in the rkhs @xmath43 . \\n a standard condition in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) for achieving decays of the form @xmath114 for the approximation error ( [ approxerrordef ] ) is @xmath115 with some @xmath116 . here \\n the operator @xmath117 is defined by @xmath118 in general , this can not be written in an additive form . \\n however , the hypothesis space ( [ additive ] ) takes an additive form @xmath119 . \\n so it is natural for us to impose an additive expression @xmath120 for the target function @xmath121 with the component functions @xmath113 satisfying the power condition @xmath110 . \\n the above natural assumption leads to a technical difficulty in estimating the approximation error : the function @xmath113 has no direct connection to the marginal distribution @xmath122 projected onto @xmath27 , hence existing methods in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) can not be applied directly . \\n note that on the product space @xmath123 , there is no natural probability measure projected from @xmath6 , and the risk on @xmath124 is not defined .    our idea to overcome the difficulty is to introduce an intermediate function @xmath125 . \\n it may not minimize a risk ( which is not even defined ) . \\n however , it approximates the component function @xmath113 well . \\n when we add up such functions @xmath126 , we get a good approximation of the target function @xmath121 , and thereby a good estimate of the approximation error . \\n this is the first novelty of the paper . \\n [ approxerrorthm ] under assumption [ assumption1 ] , we have @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the constant given by @xmath129      the second condition for our learning rates is about the capacity of the hypothesis space measured by @xmath130-empirical covering numbers .    let @xmath131 be a set of functions on @xmath21 and @xmath132 for every @xmath133 the * covering number of @xmath131 * with respect to the empirical metric @xmath134 , given by @xmath135 is defined as @xmath136 and the * @xmath130-empirical covering number * of @xmath137 is defined as @xmath138    [ assumption2 ] we assume @xmath139 and that for some @xmath140 , @xmath141 and every @xmath142 , the @xmath130-empirical covering number of the unit ball of @xmath43 satisfies @xmath143    the second novelty of this paper is to observe that the additive nature of the hypothesis space yields the following nice bound with a dimension - independent power exponent for the covering numbers of the balls of the hypothesis space @xmath0 , to be proved in section [ samplesection ] . \\n [ capacitythm ] under assumption [ assumption2 ] , for any @xmath144 and @xmath145 , we have @xmath146    the bound for the covering numbers stated in theorem [ capacitythm ] is special : the power @xmath147 is independent of the number @xmath148 of the components in the additive model . \\n it is well - known @xcite in the literature of function spaces that the covering numbers of balls of the sobolev space @xmath149 on the cube @xmath150^s$ ] of the euclidean space @xmath151 with regularity index @xmath152 has the following asymptotic behavior with @xmath153 : @xmath154 here the power @xmath155 depends linearly on the dimension @xmath148 . \\n similar dimension - dependent bounds for the covering numbers of the rkhss associated with gaussian rbf - kernels can be found in @xcite . \\n the special bound in theorem [ capacitythm ] demonstrates an advantage of the additive model in terms of capacity of the additive hypothesis space . \\n the third condition for our learning rates is about the noise level in the measure @xmath6 with respect to the hypothesis space . before stating the general condition \\n , we consider a special case for quantile regression , to illustrate our general results . \\n let @xmath156 be a quantile parameter . \\n the quantile regression function @xmath157 is defined by its value @xmath158 to be a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath160 , i.e. , a value @xmath161 satisfying @xmath162 the regularization scheme for quantile regression considered here takes the form ( [ algor ] ) with the loss function @xmath12 given by the pinball loss as @xmath163    a noise condition on @xmath6 for quantile regression is defined in @xcite as follows . to this end , let @xmath164 be a probability measure on @xmath165 and @xmath166 . then a real number @xmath167 is called @xmath159-quantile of @xmath164 , if and only if @xmath167 belongs to the set @xmath168\\\\bigr ) \\\\ge \\n \\\\tau

\\n a probability measure @xmath164 on @xmath165 is said to have a * @xmath159-quantile of type @xmath170 * , if there exist a @xmath159-quantile @xmath171 and a constant @xmath172 such that , for all @xmath173 $ ] , we have @xmath174 2 . \\n let @xmath175 $ ] . \\n we say that a probability measure @xmath20 on @xmath176 has a * @xmath159-quantile of @xmath177-average type @xmath170 * if the conditional probability measure @xmath178 has @xmath179-almost surely a @xmath159-quantile of type @xmath170 and the function @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the constant defined in part ( 1 ) , satisfies @xmath182 . \\n one can show that a distribution @xmath164 having a @xmath159-quantile of type @xmath170 has a unique @xmath159-quantile @xmath183 . \\n moreover , if @xmath164 has a lebesgue density @xmath184 then @xmath164 has a @xmath159-quantile of type @xmath170 if @xmath184 is bounded away from zero on @xmath185 $ ] since we can use @xmath186\\\\}$ ] in ( [ tauquantileoftype2formula ] ) . \\n this assumption is general enough to cover many distributions used in parametric statistics such as gaussian , student s @xmath187 , and logistic distributions ( with @xmath188 ) , gamma and log - normal distributions ( with @xmath189 ) , and uniform and beta distributions ( with @xmath190 $ ] ) . \\n the following theorem , to be proved in section [ proofsection ] , gives a learning rate for the regularization scheme ( [ algor ] ) in the special case of quantile regression . \\n [ quantilethm ] suppose that @xmath191 almost surely for some constant @xmath192 , and that each kernel @xmath41 is @xmath193 with @xmath194 for some @xmath195 . \\n if assumption [ assumption1 ] holds with @xmath112 and @xmath6 has a @xmath159-quantile of

constant independent of @xmath203 and @xmath204 and @xmath205    please note that the exponent @xmath206 given by ( [ quantilerates2 ] ) for the learning rate in ( [ quantilerates ] ) is independent of the quantile level @xmath159 , of the number @xmath148 of additive components in @xmath207 , and of the dimensions @xmath208 and @xmath209 further note that @xmath210 , if @xmath211 , and @xmath212 if @xmath213 . because @xmath214 can be arbitrarily close to @xmath215 , the learning rate , which is independent of the dimension @xmath216 and given by theorem [ quantilethm ] , is close to @xmath217 for large values of @xmath177 and is close to @xmath218 or better , if @xmath211 .      to state our general learning rates \\n , we need an assumption on a _ variance - expectation bound _ which is similar to definition [ noisecond ] in the special case of quantile regression . \\n [ assumption3 ] we assume that there exist an exponent @xmath219 $ ] and a positive constant @xmath220 such that @xmath221    assumption [ assumption3 ] always holds true for @xmath222 . if the triple @xmath223 satisfies some conditions , the exponent @xmath224 can be larger . \\n for example , when @xmath12 is the pinball loss ( [ pinloss ] ) and @xmath6 has a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath177-average type @xmath225 for some @xmath196 $ ] and @xmath226 as defined in @xcite , then @xmath227 . \\n [ mainratesthm ] suppose that @xmath228 is bounded by a constant @xmath229 almost surely . under assumptions [ assumption1 ] to [ assumption3 ] , \\n if we take @xmath198 and @xmath230 for some @xmath231 , then for any @xmath232 , with confidence at least @xmath200 we have @xmath233 where @xmath234 is given by @xmath235 and @xmath202 is constant independent of @xmath203 or @xmath204 ( to be given explicitly in the proof ) . \\n we now add some theoretical and numerical comparisons on the goodness of our learning rates with those from the literature . as already mentioned in the introduction \\n , some reasons for the popularity of additive models are flexibility , increased interpretability , and ( often ) a reduced proneness of the curse of high dimensions . \\n hence it is important to check , whether the learning rate given in theorem [ mainratesthm ] under the assumption of an additive model favourably compares to ( essentially ) optimal learning rates without this assumption . in other words , \\n we need to demonstrate that the main goal of this paper is achieved by theorem [ quantilethm ] and theorem [ mainratesthm ] , i.e. that an svm based on an additive kernel can provide a substantially better learning rate in high dimensions than an svm with a general kernel , say a classical gaussian rbf kernel , provided the assumption of an additive model is satisfied . \\n our learning rate in theorem [ quantilethm ] is new and optimal in the literature of svm for quantile regression . \\n most learning rates in the literature of svm for quantile regression are given for projected output functions @xmath236 , while it is well known that projections improve learning rates @xcite . here the projection operator @xmath237 is defined for any measurable function @xmath10 by @xmath238 sometimes this is called clipping . \\n such results are given in @xcite . \\n for example , under the assumptions that @xmath6 has a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath177-average type @xmath170 , the approximation error condition ( [ approxerrorb ] ) is satisfied for some @xmath239 , and that for some constants @xmath240 , the sequence of eigenvalues @xmath241 of the integral operator @xmath117 satisfies @xmath242 for every @xmath243 , it was shown in @xcite that with confidence at least @xmath200 , @xmath244 where @xmath245 here the parameter @xmath246 measures the capacity of the rkhs @xmath247 and it plays a similar role as half of the parameter @xmath147 in assumption 2 . for a @xmath193 kernel and @xmath112 \\n , one can choose @xmath246 and @xmath147 to be arbitrarily small and the above power index @xmath248 can be taken as @xmath249 . \\n the learning rate in theorem [ quantilethm ] may be improved by relaxing assumption 1 to a sobolev smoothness condition for @xmath121 and a regularity condition for the marginal distribution @xmath250 . \\n for example , one may use a gaussian kernel @xmath251 depending on the sample size @xmath203 and @xcite achieve the approximation error condition ( [ approxerrorb ] ) for some @xmath252 . \\n this is done for quantile regression in @xcite . \\n since we are mainly interested in additive models , we shall not discuss such an extension . \\n [ gaussmore ] let @xmath48 , @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 ^ 2.$ ] let @xmath51 and the additive kernel @xmath72 be given by ( [ gaussaddform ] ) with @xmath253 in example [ gaussadd ] as @xmath52.\\\\ ] ] if the function @xmath121 is given by ( [ gaussfcn ] ) , @xmath191 almost surely for some constant @xmath192 , and @xmath6 has a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath177-average type @xmath170 for some @xmath196 $ ] , then by taking @xmath197 , for any @xmath145 and @xmath199 , ( [ quantilerates ] ) holds with confidence at least @xmath200 .    it is unknown whether the above learning rate can be derived by existing approaches in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) even after projection . \\n note that the kernel in the above example is independent of the sample size . \\n it would be interesting to see whether there exists some @xmath99 such that the function @xmath57 defined by ( [ gaussfcn ] ) lies in the range of the operator @xmath254 . \\n the existence of such a positive index would lead to the approximation error condition ( [ approxerrorb ] ) , see @xcite .    let us now add some numerical comparisons on the goodness of our learning rates given by theorem [ mainratesthm ] with those given by @xcite . \\n their corollary 4.12 gives ( essentially ) minmax optimal learning rates for ( clipped ) svms in the context of nonparametric quantile regression using one gaussian rbf kernel on the whole input space under appropriate smoothness assumptions of the target function . \\n let us consider the case that the distribution @xmath6 has a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath177-average type @xmath170 , where @xmath255 , and assume that both corollary 4.12 in @xcite and our theorem [ mainratesthm ] are applicable . \\n i.e. , we assume in particular that @xmath6 is a probability measure on @xmath256 $ ] and that the marginal distribution @xmath257 has a lebesgue density @xmath258 for some @xmath259 . furthermore , suppose that the optimal decision function @xmath260 has ( to make theorem [ mainratesthm ] applicable with @xmath261 $ ] ) the additive structure @xmath207 with each @xmath104 as stated in assumption [ assumption1 ] , where @xmath262 and @xmath263 , with minimal risk @xmath86 and additionally fulfills ( to make corollary 4.12 in @xcite applicable ) @xmath264 where @xmath265 $ ] and @xmath266 denotes a besov space with smoothness parameter @xmath267 . \\n the intuitive meaning of @xmath248 is , that increasing values of @xmath248 correspond to increased smoothness . \\n we refer to ( * ? ? ? * and p. 44 ) for details on besov spaces . \\n it is well - known that the besov space @xmath268 contains the sobolev space @xmath269 for @xmath270 , @xmath271 , and @xmath272 , and that @xmath273 . \\n we mention that if all @xmath41 are suitably chosen wendland kernels , their reproducing kernel hilbert spaces @xmath43 are sobolev spaces , see ( * ? ? ? \\n * thm . 10.35 , p. 160 ) . \\n furthermore , we use the same sequence of regularizing parameters as in ( * ? ? ? \\n 4.9 , cor . 4.12 ) , i.e. , @xmath274 where @xmath275 , @xmath276 , @xmath277 $ ] , and @xmath278 is some user - defined positive constant independent of @xmath279 . for \\n reasons of simplicity , let us fix @xmath280 . \\n then ( * ? ? ? \\n 4.12 ) gives learning rates for the risk of svms for @xmath159-quantile regression , if a single gaussian rbf - kernel on @xmath281 is used for @xmath159-quantile functions of @xmath177-average type @xmath170 with @xmath255 , which are of order @xmath282 hence the learning rate in theorem [ quantilethm ] is better than the one in ( * ? ? ? \\n 4.12 ) in this situation , if @xmath283 provided the assumption of the additive model is valid .

       " {'content': '**Abstract**\\n\\nQuantum tunneling through potential barriers is a fundamental phenomenon in nuclear physics, particularly in processes such as alpha decay. While the parabolic approximation has long been used to calculate barrier penetrability, it fails at low energies—much below the Coulomb barrier—due to the long-range nature of the Coulomb interaction. In this work, we derive a new analytical formula for barrier penetrability based on the WKB approximation that properly accounts for the Coulomb tail in the potential. By dividing the potential into inner and outer regions and applying a Woods-Saxon form to the nuclear part, we obtain a closed-form expression that accurately describes the penetration probability at energies well below the barrier. We apply this formula to calculate alpha decay half-lives for 344 nuclei using realistic nuclear and Coulomb potentials. For spherical and even-even nuclei, our results show excellent agreement with experimental data, with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.34. The new formula reproduces the WKB results well and significantly improves upon the parabolic approximation in the low-energy regime. It is especially useful for systems where energy-dependent potentials or barrier distributions are involved, offering a practical analytical tool for studying sub-barrier tunneling phenomena.',\n",
